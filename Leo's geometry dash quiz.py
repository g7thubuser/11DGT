Were you even trying? Or were you just mashing random keys like a Wave player with lag?\n\
This quiz was meant to be a two star, but somehow you made it look like Silent Circles.\n\
You had *three* chances per question and still couldn't break 40 points?\n\
Even RobTop is shaking his head right now.\n\
You might want to go back to Stereo Madness and rethink your life choices.\n\
You're not a geometry dasher, you're a geometry crasher'.\n\
Next time, try reading the questions instead of speedrunning failure.\n\
Now go hit the practice mode... you need it.\n")
